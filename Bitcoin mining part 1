"""
CHALLENGE
Have a look at the following code, understand how it works
and test it.
Your challenge is to "mine" a hash value using the input "bitcoin".
The first person to find a returning hash value that has two
leading 00s wins.
e.g. 00xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (should be returned as a hash value)
If you get two 0s at the start of the hash value returned, you have
won!!!!!!!!
